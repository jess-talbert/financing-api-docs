3. Integration Patterns (merchant onboarding, consumer application, quotes, status)
4. Unique Features (pre-qual, co-borrowers, multi-draw, documents, stipulations)
5. Technical Requirements (SDKs, versioning, performance, uptime)
6. Security & Compliance (certifications, data security, audit logging, compliance)

**Use Case**: Evaluate providers who submitted complete Technical RFI

**Scoring Categories**:
| Category | Weight | Focus Areas |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| API Quality | 40% | Documentation, design, errors, data models, security |

| Support & Partnership | 5% | Integration support, existing experience |

**Output**: 
- **Tier 1** (4.0-5.0): Priority launch partner - integrate immediately
