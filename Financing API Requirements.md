# Stripe-Affirm Partnership Example

## Overview

Reference implementation example for offering financing as a contractor using Stripe's partnership with Affirm. This demonstrates how contractors can integrate point-of-sale financing directly into their payment workflows, providing customers with flexible payment options at the point of purchase.

**Integration Type:** Stripe Payment Methods + Affirm Financing
**Use Case:** Contractor offering financing options to customers for home improvement projects
**Payment Flow:** Integrated checkout with financing options

## Stripe-Affirm Integration Pattern

### Contractor Financing Workflow

#### 1. Project Estimation & Quote
```javascript
// Example: Create Stripe Payment Intent with Affirm as payment method
const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: projectTotal * 100, // Amount in cents
  currency: 'usd',
  payment_method_types: ['card', 'affirm'],
  metadata: {
    contractor_id: 'contractor_12345',
    project_type: 'home_improvement',
    customer_id: 'customer_67890'
  }
});
```

#### 2. Customer Financing Options
- **Immediate Financing Approval:** Affirm provides instant credit decisions
- **Flexible Terms:** Multiple payment plan options (3, 6, 12, 18, 24+ months)
- **Transparent Pricing:** Clear APR and payment terms displayed upfront
- **No Hidden Fees:** All costs disclosed during checkout process

#### 3. Contractor Benefits
- **Immediate Payment:** Contractor receives full payment upfront from Affirm
- **Reduced Risk:** No customer credit risk for contractor
- **Higher Conversion:** Financing options can increase project acceptance rates
- **Simple Integration:** Leverages existing Stripe payment infrastructure

### Technical Implementation

#### Frontend Integration
```javascript
// Stripe Elements with Affirm support
const stripe = Stripe('pk_test_...');
const elements = stripe.elements();

// Create Affirm payment element
const affirmElement = elements.create('affirm', {
  // Affirm-specific options
  confirmationMethod: 'automatic',
  returnUrl: 'https://contractor-site.com/payment/return'
});

affirmElement.mount('#affirm-element');
```

#### Payment Confirmation
```javascript
// Handle payment confirmation
const confirmPayment = async () => {
  const {error, paymentIntent} = await stripe.confirmAffirmPayment(
    clientSecret,
    {
      payment_method: {
        affirm: affirmElement
      },
      return_url: 'https://contractor-site.com/payment/complete'
    }
  );
  
  if (error) {
    // Handle payment failure
    console.error('Payment failed:', error);
  } else if (paymentIntent.status === 'succeeded') {
    // Payment successful - contractor can proceed with project
    updateProjectStatus('payment_confirmed');
  }
};
```

## Contractor Use Case Scenarios

### Home Improvement Financing
- **Project Types:** Kitchen remodels, bathroom renovations, roofing, HVAC systems
- **Typical Amounts:** $5,000 - $50,000+ projects
- **Customer Benefits:** Spread large expenses over manageable monthly payments
- **Contractor Benefits:** Secure immediate payment, reduce financing friction

### Service Integration Points
```javascript
// Example: JobNimbus integration with Stripe-Affirm
const createFinancedProject = async (projectData) => {
  // 1. Create project estimate in JobNimbus
  const project = await jobnimbus.projects.create({
    customer_id: projectData.customer_id,
    project_type: projectData.type,
    estimated_amount: projectData.amount,
    financing_enabled: true
  });
  
  // 2. Generate Stripe Payment Intent with Affirm
  const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
    amount: projectData.amount * 100,
    currency: 'usd',
    payment_method_types: ['affirm'],
    metadata: {
      jobnimbus_project_id: project.id,
      financing_provider: 'affirm'
    }
  });
  
  // 3. Return financing options to customer
  return {
    project_id: project.id,
    client_secret: paymentIntent.client_secret,
    financing_available: true
  };
};
```
